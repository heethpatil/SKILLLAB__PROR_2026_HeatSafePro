## 1.4 One-Line Pitch

`A wearable system that detects dangerous heat stress in outdoor workers and alerts supervisors before it becomes fatal.`

## 1.5 Expanded Project Idea

In 1–2 paragraphs, explain:

- what your project is,
- what kind of experience it creates,
- what technologies are involved.

**Response:**  
`Every summer in India, thousands of outdoor workers — construction labourers, road workers, and daily wage earners — collapse and die from heat stroke because nobody is monitoring them. Our solution, Heat Stress Guardian, is a two part wearable safety system designed to fix this. A DHT11 sensor embedded in a cardboard wristband continuously reads temperature and humidity, sending both values to the RP2040 Shrike Lite which calculates the Heat Index — the same formula doctors and meteorologists use to assess real danger to the human body. This matters because 38°C at 90% humidity feels like 51°C and is fatal, while 38°C at 30% humidity is manageable — a basic thermometer cannot tell the difference but our device can. When the heat index crosses a critical threshold, a buzzer alerts the worker to stop, while simultaneously a red LED and serial monitor at the supervisor station display live readings and a DANGER status so the supervisor can immediately intervene.`

        https://www.downtoearth.org.in/climate-change/warm-nights-above-normal-heat-waves-across-india-in-april-june-2026-imd

What makes your project original?

**Response:**  `Most heat alert systems only measure temperature. We measure heat index — temperature combined with humidity — which is the actual medical standard for heat stroke risk. We also add RFID worker registration so the system knows who is being monitored. No existing low-cost solution combines all three of these for daily wage outdoor workers.`

# 4. Project Intent

## 4.1 User Journey 

Describe exactly how a user will use the project.Make it a story

**Response:** `We can think its 8am on a construction site in Mumbai. Chirag, a daily wage labourer, arrives for his shift. Before picking up his tools he walks to the supervisor station and taps his RFID card to check in. The serial monitor will print his name , and start monitoring him. 
By 1pm the temperature has climbed to 38°C and humidity is at 85%. The heat index calculated by the RP2040 crosses 42°C — the danger threshold. The buzzer at the supervisor station fires hence the red LED lights up. The serial monitor flashes DANGER — HEAT INDEX 42°C — WORKER RAJAN — FORCE REST NOW.
The supervisor looks up immediately and radios Chirag to stop work and move to shade. Chirag rests for 20 minutes till the environment cools and the system resets to green. Now He can safely go back to work.`

## 5.2 Minimum Usable Version

What is the smallest version of this project that still delivers the core experience?

**Response:**  


## 5.3 Stretch Features

What features are nice to have but not essential?

`RFID worker registration is a good feature that adds identity tracking to the system but is not essential to the core safety function. The primary purpose of Heat Stress Guardian is detecting dangerous heat conditions and alerting supervisors in real time so this works without RFID too.`

## 6.2 High-Level System Description

Explain how the system works in simple terms.

Include:

- input,
- processing,
- output,
- physical structure,
- app interaction if any.

**Response:**  `The Heat Stress Guardian is a two-part worker safety system. A worker taps their RFID card to register at the start of shift — this activates monitoring. The wristband unit continuously reads temperature and humidity via DHT11, ambient light via LDR, and heart rate via pulse sensor clipped to the finger. All readings are sent to the RP2040 Shrike Lite which calculates the heat index every few seconds. If the heat index crosses 39°C the system triggers a two-stage alert — buzzer fires, red LED lights up, and the serial monitor on the supervisor's laptop displays live readings with a DANGER status showing exactly which worker is at risk. When conditions return to safe levels the green LED lights up and the system resets automatically.`

## 8.2 Wiring Plan

Describe the main electrical connections.

**Response:**  
`The RP2040 Shrike Lite acts as the central controller. The DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor is connected to GP0 for digital data reading. The LDR is connected to GP26 via a voltage divider with a 10k resistor to read analog light levels. The pulse sensor signal pin connects to GP27, another ADC-capable pin, for analog heart rate reading. The PIR sensor output connects to GP1 for digital presence detection.
The RFID RC522 communicates over SPI — SCK to GP18, MOSI to GP19, MISO to GP16, CS to GP17, and RST to GP20. The buzzer positive connects to GP2. Red LED connects to GP3 and green LED to GP4, each with a 220 ohm resistor in series to limit current. All component grounds connect to a common GND rail on the breadboard. The 9V battery positive connects to the VSYS pin of the RP2040 which has onboard voltage regulation.`

## 10.2 Software Logic

Describe what the code must do.

Include:

- startup behavior,
- input handling,
- sensor reading,
- decision logic,
- output behavior,
- communication logic,
- reset behavior.

**Response:**  
`
Startup behavior:
The RP2040 initializes all GPIO pins for buzzer, red LED, and green LED. DHT11 and LDR begin continuous reading. RFID RC522 initializes over SPI and waits for a card tap. Serial monitor prints "Heat Stress Guardian — Ready. Waiting for worker registration."
Input handling:
System waits for RFID card tap first. Once worker card is detected and ID is registered, DHT11 and LDR activate monitoring. No monitoring happens before RFID registration.
Sensor reading:
DHT11 reads temperature in °C and humidity in % every 2 seconds. LDR reads analog light value continuously — high value means direct sunlight, low value means shade or indoor conditions.
Decision logic:
RP2040 calculates heat index from temperature and humidity using the standard Rothfusz formula. If LDR detects direct sunlight, danger threshold is automatically lowered by 3°C to account for solar radiation load. If heat index crosses 39°C in shade or 36°C in direct sunlight — DANGER is triggered. If heat index is between 35°C and 39°C — WARNING state.
Output behavior:
SAFE → green LED on, serial monitor prints live temp, humidity, heat index, and light condition every 2 seconds. WARNING → serial monitor prints WARNING with current readings. DANGER → red LED on, buzzer triggers, serial monitor prints "DANGER — WORKER [ID] — HEAT INDEX [value]°C — FORCE REST NOW."
Communication logic:
All output through serial monitor at 9600 baud. Supervisor laptop displays live readings in real time. No wireless communication in current version.
Reset behavior:
When heat index drops below safe threshold, system automatically resets to SAFE. Green LED turns on, buzzer stops, serial monitor prints "SAFE — conditions normal." RFID worker registration persists until device is powered off or restarted.

## 11.2 Material Justification

Explain why you selected your main materials and components.

**Response:**  
`DC motors (BO motors) were chosen instead of servos or steppers because the system requires continuous rotation for movement rather than precise angular control (Previously, we were considering using steppers as we were planning on tracking movement on the ESP using its relative position from an origin, but since we're using a camera now, this is not required). A motor driver (L298N) was used to allow bidirectional control and speed variation using PWM.`

# 16. Build Documentation

## 16.1 Fabrication Process

Describe how the project was physically made.

Include:

- cutting,
- 3D printing,
- assembly,
- fastening,
- wiring,
- finishing,
- revisions.

**Response:**  
`The fabrication process involved designing, manufacturing, assembling, and refining both the physical structure and electronic integration of the system.`

`Design (CAD Modeling):
The initial model was created using CAD software, where components were designed based on the actual dimensions of the electronic parts. This ensured accurate fitting and minimized errors during assembly.
Cutting (Laser Cutting):
The designed parts were fabricated using laser cutting techniques. Sheets were cut precisely according to the CAD model to create the structural base and mounts for components.`

`Components were fixed using adhesives and mechanical supports. Certain parts were intentionally kept modular (not permanently fixed) to allow easy replacement and modification of electronics.
Surface Finishing:
Some parts were sanded to smooth rough edges after cutting. Sawdust mixed with adhesive was used to fill gaps and uneven edges, improving structural finish. The final structure was then painted for better aesthetics and durability.`

`Environment Setup (Dark Room Fabrication):
To enhance projection visibility, a controlled dark environment was created using Z-boards, paper sheets, and bedsheets. This minimized external light interference and improved projection clarity.
Revisions and Iterations:
Multiple adjustments were made throughout the process, including refining alignment, improving structural stability, repositioning components, and optimizing the interaction between the physical car and projected environment.`
